<center> <u><h2>Our Family History</h2></u></center>

	<p> The Rossi family came from the moutains of northern Italy to now resides in the small burrow of Queens, New York. While during the mist of missing
 the mountains, the family started going back to the routes of cookings. By inspiring cooking back into the household, it created the some of the most family famous recipes. Anything from fresh made risotto to handmade 
pizza crust and to beautiful pesto gnocchi was made in the small apartment in Queens. With the love for all things cooking, they decided to bring that love to you. Now with generations upon generations of the Christi 
family keeping the ideals of cooking at the heart of gathering love ones, they were inspired to start Cooking Cabin. </p>
 
	<p> Cooking Cabin started as a small local shop on the corner of Farrington St and Northern Boulevard, Christie and Chris started with small cooking classes to help inspired family friends and others in the neighborhood to start reclaiming there kitchens
again back in 2000. Everyone in the neighbor had always loved the Rossis' cooking and wanted it to become their own. With the success of the cooking classes, the shop went on to bigger events such as birthday parties, private parties, and 
cartering. And the Cooking Cabin has only grown from there. </p>

	<p> To present day, Cooking Cabin has not only expanded from the local shop but to 10 amazing locations throughout the New York area wanting everyone to regain the kitchen as a part of family time. With more inhenced cooking classes, 
we have expanded our services to fit more of your needs from meal prep even to baking to regain the love for your kitchen. We have also expanded Cooking Cabin to an amazing catering service from any event you may need because with us, you are
family. But in order to make you feel the most like family, back in 2019 we had launched our own cooking line of products. From the everyday deluxe pan to the crock pot you may need for the next family reunion. We want to be with you every step 
of the way. If you are interested in learning more about our products and services, please head over to the page to check it out. </p>
